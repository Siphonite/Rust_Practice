Rust Practice Repository

- Welcome to my Rust Practice Repository! This repository is a collection of small Rust projects created to learn and improve my Rust programming skills. It contains hundreds of individual projects, each in its own folder, covering various Rust concepts such as basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and more.

**Purpose**

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document my learning journey with Rust.
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code.
- Organize a large number of small projects for easy reference and scalability.
- Share my work with the Rust community for feedback and collaboration.

**Repository Structure**
- The repository is organized to accommodate hundreds of projects, grouped by category for clarity. Each project is a self-contained Rust program with its own Cargo.toml and source code.
