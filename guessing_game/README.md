# Guessing Game

This is a simple Rust project created alongside the official Rust Book tutorial to gain hands-on experience with Rust concepts. The project is a follow-along of the [Guessing Game tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) from *The Rust Programming Language* book.

## Overview

The Guessing Game is a command-line application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a range. It serves as a practical exercise to understand:

- Variables and data types
- User input handling
- Loops and conditionals
- Error handling with `Result` and `Option`
- Using external crates (`rand`)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Guessing_Game
